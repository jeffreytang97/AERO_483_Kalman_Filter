# AERO_483_Kalman_Filter

This project consists of designing a Kalman Filter to predict a simulated trajectory of a drone.

Programming Language: Matlab

1) Analyse state estimates of system dynamics (INS).
2) Analyse the output from GPS data.
3) Analyse state estimates of system dynamics with random noises.
4) Designing a Kalman Filter to compare with the system dynamics data.
